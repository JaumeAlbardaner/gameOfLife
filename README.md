## 1. Rules

- Any live cell with **fewer than two live neighbours dies**, as if caused by under-population.
- Any live cell with **two or three live neighbours lives on** to the next generation
- Any live cell with **more than three live neighbours dies**, as if by over-population.
- Any **dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell**, as if by reproduction.
